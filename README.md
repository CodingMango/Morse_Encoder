Morse code Encoder and Transmitter (through buzzer and LED)

Morse code is the oldest method used for wireless data transfer in an encrypted format. 
I have used a piezoelectric buzzer and an LED to transmit/output the encrypted message and simultaneously the message will be printed on the serial monitor.
Arduino UNO microcontroller is used to encrypt messages.



The Logic Behind the Morse Code Encoder is given in the Arduino sketch (file with .ino extension)
